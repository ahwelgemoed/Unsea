Students are tasked with coming up with an experimental web UI which will create a unique interactive
experience for users. The Lecturer will be acting as the “client”, providing the students with a basic idea for which
to start from. Students will need to consult with the “client” regarding the experience they are creating for the
“client”.

Consider that the promotional site is meant to drive excitement and interest for a company prior to launch.
Therefore there will not be any pre-created images and videos for designers to use so they must create an
experience which will stand in place of the missing elements.
